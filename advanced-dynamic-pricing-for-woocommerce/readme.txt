All discount types - flexible and feature rich plugin.

== Description ==

This plugin helps you  quickly set discounts and pricing rules for your WooCommerce store.

Set up any kind of discount or dynamic pricing you like, and activate/deactivate rules as needed.

Configure fixed dollar amount adjustments, percentage adjustments, or set fixed price for the product or group of products.

Also supports role-based prices & bulk pricing. **Bulk tables can be designed with Customizer.** You should setup bulk rule for category/product at first and enable "Show Bulk Table" at tab "Settings".

= Some Examples  =

* Category-level discounts - discount products and provide free shipping
* Buy 4(or more) items on Friday and get 20% off
* Buy product X and get product Y for free - immediately added and visible in cart
* Buy a package -  discount it (each item separately), and also get a free product
* Apply bulk discount for selected items, available only to wholesale buyers
* Give a 10% discount to all "Accessories"(Category) if a product X is present in the cart

Check more examples [on our website](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/sample-discount/).

= One pricing rule can  =
* Filter cart items by products, categories, tags or custom fields
* Modify price for each product separately
* Or set total price for whole set
* Apply cart discounts and fees
* Add free products on fly
* Use tables to get bulk rates
* Validate conditions for cart items, user roles or dates
* Track limits (only "max usage" supported currently)

= Interface settings =
* Show/hide original prices
* Show/hide badge "On Sale"
* Show/hide bulk discount table on the product page
* Set rule for  products which already on sale
* Add shortcodes to display discounted or BOGO products at separate pages
* and much more ...

[Pro version](https://algolplus.com/plugins/downloads/advanced-dynamic-pricing-woocommerce-pro/?currency=USD) can [adjust product price onfly](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/advanced-features-in-action/), adds **exclusive rules, extra conditions and a lot of settings(which allow you to configure different layouts and scenarios).

== Installation ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I increase prices in my shop? =
You should setup negative discount.
= The plugin slows down my site a lot. Sometimes the cart page just freezes. =
It seems your websitе calls external API to do shipping calculations.
Please, visit >WooCommerce>Pricing Rules>Settings>Calculation, mark "Disable shipping calculation" and check speed.
= Free product can't be added to the cart. I see message "Sorry, this product cannot be purchased." =
WooCommerce verifies product before adding to the cart. So this product must be published, in stock and has price defined.
= How can I hide original prices? =
It's a PRO feature. You should turn off option "Show striked prices" at tab Settings, for category and product pages.
= I don't see "For sale" badge for variable products =
It's a PRO feature. You should turn on option "Calculate 'On Sale' badge for variable products" at tab Settings, section Calculations.
= Is it compatible with WPML? WOOCS ? =
Yes.
= Compatibility with my theme/plugin =
Free and pro versions use same core, so you can test it using free version. [Please, visit the link to see detailed reply](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/common-faq/)
= How to allow customer to select free product =
You should create package rule and set zero price for free product. [Please, check 2nd example](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/bogo-discount-help/)
= How to customize bulk tables or row "amount saved" =
You should copy necessary file from folder “BaseVersion/templates” to folder “advanced-dynamic-pricing-for-woocommerce” (create it in active theme)
= The rules are not applied to orders if I use button "Add order" (>WooCommerce>Orders) =
This form adds new order directly to the database. But all pricing plugins work with cart items. Use our plugin [Phone Orders](https://wordpress.org/plugins/phone-orders-for-woocommerce/) to add backend orders.
= I can't change quantity or delete item from cart =
It's a conflict with another plugin which modifies cart items too. You should turn on debugbar and send us report/json file. [Read short guide.](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/debug/)
= I marked checkbox "Add products to cart at normal cost and add coupon...", but I don't see any coupons in the cart =
You should visit >WooCommerce>Settings and mark "Enable the use of coupon codes".
= I need custom cart condition =
You should be PHP programmer to do it. [Please, review sample addon and adapt it for your needs](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/program-custom-condition/)
= I don't see my question   =
